== About

This app was born from the idea that you can only search for parking on Google Maps, but not every area to park is actually a designated parking space, so finding these areas is impossible on the internet. Using the app is simple: you can either upload a parking zone or browse for parking near you. You can upload both parking zones and legitimate parking businesses. You can add different tags to the parking spaces, such as whether it is covered, free, or if it can charge electric vehicles. Additionally, users can comment on and rate various aspects of the parking.

This app comes in handy when you travel frequently and youâ€™re in search of reliable, free parking spots.
